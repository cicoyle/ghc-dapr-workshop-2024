# 2024 GHC Level Up Lab
## Spike Your Application Development Skills with Dapr
### With Sam & Cassandra Coyle, Diagrid

### Overview
Simplifying writing complex distributed apps seems impossible, right? Developers today face immense pressure to write secure, scalable, resilient, portable, and fault-tolerant apps, making this a big ask.
Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) alleviates the challenges of building cloud-native, containerized apps by providing APIs & SDKs (.Net, Java, JS, Go, and more) that abstract away the complexities of microservice development. Dapr sidecars take care of many challenges devs would otherwise have to write in their app code—such as service discovery and invocation, observability, and resiliency—all while allowing developers to write in the language that makes the most sense for their use case.

This workshop aims to spike attendee web development skills and knowledge through a hands-on volleyball application development journey, using Dapr and Go. This workshop aims to showcase the simplicity of Dapr, and how it alleviates common application development challenges.
