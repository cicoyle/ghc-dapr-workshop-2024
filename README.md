# 2024 GHC Level Up Lab
## Spike Your Application Development Skills with Dapr
### With Samantha & Cassie Coyle, Diagrid

### Overview
Simplifying writing complex distributed apps seems impossible, right? Developers today face immense pressure to write 
secure, scalable, resilient, portable, and fault-tolerant apps, making this a big ask.
Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) alleviates the challenges of building cloud-native, containerized apps by 
providing APIs & SDKs (.Net, Java, JS, Go, and more) that abstract away the complexities of microservice development. 
Dapr sidecars take care of many challenges devs would otherwise have to write in their app code—such as service 
discovery and invocation, observability, and resiliency—all while allowing developers to write in the language that 
makes the most sense for their use case.

This workshop aims to spike attendee web development skills and knowledge through a hands-on volleyball application 
development journey, using Dapr and Go. This workshop aims to showcase the simplicity of Dapr, and how it alleviates 
comment application development challenges.
